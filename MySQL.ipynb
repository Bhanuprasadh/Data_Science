        "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that facilitates efficient retrieval, updating, and management of data. It provides mechanisms for storing, retrieving, modifying, and querying data in a structured format.\n",
        "\n",
        "**SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Structure:** SQL databases are relational databases that organize data into tables with rows and columns. Each table has a predefined schema, specifying the structure of the data.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Data Model:** SQL databases follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data consistency and integrity. They use a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data must be defined before storing data.\n",
        "  \n",
        "3. **Query Language:** SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data. SQL provides a standard syntax for performing operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Examples:** Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Structure:** NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in flexible, schema-less formats. They can store data as key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graph databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Model:** NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally and handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They may sacrifice some of the ACID properties in favor of scalability and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Query Language:** NoSQL databases may use different query languages or APIs depending on the type of database. Some NoSQL databases have their own query languages, while others support APIs like MongoDB's query language or Cassandra's CQL (Cassandra Query Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Examples:** Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Model:** SQL databases use a fixed schema with tables and relations, while NoSQL databases offer more flexible data models like key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Scalability:** NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally and handle large volumes of data more effectively than SQL databases, which may require complex scaling solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Query Language:** SQL databases use SQL for querying and manipulation, while NoSQL databases may use their own query languages or APIs tailored to their data model.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Consistency:** SQL databases typically enforce strong consistency and ACID properties, while NoSQL databases may offer eventual consistency and relax some ACID properties for better scalability and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Use Cases:** SQL databases are often used for applications with structured data and complex queries, such as transactional systems and relational data models. NoSQL databases are commonly used for applications with rapidly changing data, big data, real-time analytics, and distributed systems."

        "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for defining and modifying the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, constraints, etc. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and drop database objects, as well as to define constraints on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an explanation of commonly used DDL statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **CREATE:** The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, and sequences. It specifies the name of the object being created, along with its structure and any additional properties. For example, to create a new table named \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary, you can use the following SQL statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
        "       employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "       name VARCHAR(100),\n",
        "       salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
        "   );\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **DROP:** The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, or sequences. It removes the specified object from the database schema. For example, to drop the \"employees\" table created in the previous example, you can use the following SQL statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   DROP TABLE employees;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **ALTER:** The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of existing database objects, such as tables or indexes. It allows you to add, modify, or drop columns, constraints, or other properties of the object. For example, to add a new column named \"department\" to the \"employees\" table, you can use the following SQL statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   ALTER TABLE employees\n",
        "   ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **TRUNCATE:** The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table while retaining its structure. Unlike the DROP statement, which deletes the entire table along with its structure, TRUNCATE only removes data, leaving the table's structure intact. For example, to remove all rows from the \"employees\" table without deleting the table itself, you can use the following SQL statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, DDL statements such as CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects in SQL databases. They allow database administrators and developers to create, modify, and delete tables, indexes, constraints, and other database objects as needed to support the requirements of the application."

        "\n",
        "1. **INSERT:** The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table. It specifies the name of the table into which data will be inserted, along with the values to be inserted into each column of the table. For example, to insert a new record into a table named \"students\" with columns for student ID, name, and age, you can use the following SQL statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age)\n",
        "   VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 25);\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This statement inserts a new row into the \"students\" table with the specified values for the student ID, name, and age columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **UPDATE:** The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. It specifies the name of the table to be updated, along with the columns to be modified and the new values for those columns. Additionally, you can specify conditions to filter which rows should be updated. For example, to update the age of a student with the student ID of 1 in the \"students\" table, you can use the following SQL statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   UPDATE students\n",
        "   SET age = 26\n",
        "   WHERE student_id = 1;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This statement updates the age of the student with the student ID of 1 to 26.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **DELETE:** The DELETE statement is used to remove rows of data from a table. It specifies the name of the table from which rows will be deleted, along with optional conditions to filter which rows should be deleted. If no conditions are specified, all rows in the table will be deleted. For example, to delete a student with the student ID of 1 from the \"students\" table, you can use the following SQL statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   DELETE FROM students\n",
        "   WHERE student_id = 1;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This statement deletes the row from the \"students\" table where the student ID is 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, DML statements such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are used to manipulate data stored in database tables.

        "2. **Non-null:** The primary key column(s) cannot contain null values. Every row in the table must have a valid primary key value.\n",
        "  \n",
        "3. **Immutability:** The primary key value(s) should not change over time. Once a primary key value is assigned to a row, it should remain unchanged for the lifetime of that row.\n",
