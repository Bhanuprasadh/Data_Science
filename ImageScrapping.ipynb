        "\n",
        "1. **Import Libraries**: Import `requests` for making HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` for parsing HTML.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **get_youtube_video_posting_times Function**:\n",
        "   - Takes `channel_url` as input which should point to the YouTube channel's videos page.\n",
        "   - Sends a GET request to the provided `channel_url` and retrieves the HTML content of the page.\n",
        "   - Uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content.\n",
        "   - Finds all `<div>` elements that have the `id` attribute set to `metadata-line`. These elements typically contain video metadata, including the posting time.\n",
        "   - Iterates over these elements to extract the text of the second `<span>` element (which usually contains the posting time) and adds it to the `posting_times` list.\n",
        "   - Stops after collecting the posting times of the first five videos.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Example Usage**:\n",
        "   - Replace `'https://www.youtube.com/c/your_channel_name/videos'` with the actual URL of the YouTube channel you want to extract posting times from.\n",
        "   - Calls `get_youtube_video_posting_times` function with `channel_url`.\n",
        "   - Prints out each extracted posting time.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Output**:\n",
        "   - For each video, the program prints the posting time.\n",
        "\n",
        "This script assumes that the structure of YouTube's HTML for posting times remains consistent. Adjustments might be necessary if YouTube changes its HTML structure in the future."
