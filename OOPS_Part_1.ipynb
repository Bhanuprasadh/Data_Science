        "Accessing Instance Variables: Using the self keyword, you can access the instance variables of the current object. This allows you to retrieve or modify data that is specific to that instance of the class.\n",

        "Calling Instance Methods: When you call an instance method, you need to specify which instance of the class you want to call it on. You can do this using the self keyword, which tells the interpreter to call the method on the current object.\n",

        "Creating New Instances: In many cases, you will want to create new instances of a class. To do this, you can call the class constructor and pass in any necessary arguments. Within the constructor, you can use the self keyword to refer to the new instance that is being created.\n",

You can then create a new class called \"Penguin\" that inherits from both the \"Bird\" class and the \"Swim\" class, which contains properties and methods specific to swimming, such as \"swim speed\" and \"dive depth\".\n",

You can then create a new class called \"Mammal\" that inherits from the \"Animal\" class, and adds its own unique properties and methods, such as \"fur\" and \"nurse\". Finally, you can create a new class called \"Cat\" that inherits from the \"Mammal\" class, and adds its own unique properties and methods, such as \"meow\" and \"claw\".\n",
