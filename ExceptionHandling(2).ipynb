        "Here is a brief explanation of exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is disrupted and Python raises an exception that can be handled. Some common built-in exceptions in Python include ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, TypeError, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "A syntax error, on the other hand, occurs when Python encounters incorrect syntax in the code. Syntax errors prevent Python from even executing the code. Some examples of syntax errors are missing colon, unmatched parentheses, missing quotes, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main differences between exceptions and syntax errors are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Exceptions occur during execution, syntax errors occur during parsing/compilation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Exceptions can be handled by the program, syntax errors cannot be handled and stop the execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Exceptions provide information about what went wrong and where using traceback, syntax errors only indicate something is wrong with the syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Examples of exceptions are ZeroDivisionError, ImportError etc. Examples of syntax errors are missing commas, unmatched brackets etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Exceptions do not stop the program execution immediately, the program can continue after handling the exception. Syntax errors stop the execution immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "So in summary, syntax errors are coding mistakes that violate Python syntax rules and exceptions are runtime errors that occur during execution and can be handled within the program. Exceptions provide a way to handle errors gracefully while syntax errors crash the program."
